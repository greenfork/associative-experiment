# Associative linguistic experiment
This experiment is briefly described on the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_by_association). But in contrary to psychology this experiment focuses mainly on language and words which is closer to psycholinguistics.

## Brief history
Usually this experiment is conducted in the way that respondents are given questionnaire sheets where they fill in their age, sex, native language and nationality leaving name and surname, hence the experiment is conducted anonymously. Next they see a list of words (usually around 100) and an empty field to fill beside these words. The respondents write their association to the word next to it in the field and repeat till all the 100 fields are filled.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this software is to automate acquisition of the respondents' reactions and provide convenient tools to view and administer this process and the results including research specific statistics and metrics.

## Usage
This software is effectively useless without the data of the respondents. So far there are no freely available interfaces for interaction with users and respondents beside collecting their reactions but this is a feature to be added soon!

## Contributing
Feel free to suggest any ideas on how you, as a respondent, would like to view your results, compare it to other results and whatever makes you want to complete this experiment.
